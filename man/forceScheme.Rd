\title{Force Scheme}
\usage{
forceScheme(d, initial = NULL, maxIt = 50, tol = 0.1, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A dissimilarity structure such as that returned by dist or a full
symmetric matrix containing the dissimilarities.}

\item{initial}{A initial 2D configuration (optional). A random configuration
will be created when omitted.}

\item{maxIt}{The maximum number of iterations that the method will run.}

\item{tol}{The tolerance for the accumulated error between iterations. Set it
to 0 to guarantee it will run maxIt times.}

\item{verbose}{A flag that indicates if the progress should be printed.}
}
\value{
The 2D representation of the data.
}
\description{
Create a 2D representation of the data based on a dissimilarity matrix. A few
modifications have been made in relation to the method described in the
literature: shuffled indices are used to minimize the order dependency
factor, only a fraction of delta is used for better stability and a tolerance
factor was introduced as a second stop criterion.

\examples{
# Eurodist example
proj = forceScheme(eurodist)
plot(proj, type = "n", xlab ="", ylab ="", asp=1, axes=FALSE, main="")
text(proj, labels(eurodist), cex = 0.6)

# Iris example
proj = forceScheme(dist(iris[,1:4]))
plot(proj, col=iris$Species)
